About Ekyaalo: Ekyaalo is recently grant-funded by the American Cancer Society to pursue innovations to improve the throughput, speed, and accessibility of breast cancer diagnosis particularly in the low-resource setting. This is an excellent opportunity for those interested in global health, women's health, pathology, Machine Learning, biomedical engineering, and the intersection of these areas with software engineering and app development.
